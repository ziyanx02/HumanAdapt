- Added "feet_link_names" in the environment configuration:
  - This specifies the names of links corresponding to the feet/fingertips crucial for motion.
  - It is necessary for initialization of `feet_link_indices` in the state wrapper.

- Retained other configuration details:
  - The `gait` section allows for configurable patterns for smooth and stable movements.
  - Observation parameters remain robust, supporting noise and scaling for various states.
  - Randomization sections like `randomize_base_mass` allow for domain adaptation.
  - Reward scales are rich, balancing optimization and penalization for robot actions.
